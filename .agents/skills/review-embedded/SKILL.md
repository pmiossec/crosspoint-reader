# Embedded constraints review

Review the pinned logical change. Consult relevant sections of hardware, HAL,
coding, or lifecycle rules for the contracts it changes; use project skills only
when their decision procedure is needed. Do not edit files or run handoff.

Review the diff for:

- worst-case heap use, allocation failure, fragmentation, lifetime, and largest contiguous block;
- stack growth, task stack sizing, ISR safety, RISC-V alignment, and task cleanup;
- flash/DRAM placement, template or `std::function` bloat, and string use in hot paths;
- repeated work, blocking I/O, watchdog exposure, timing assumptions, and E-Ink refresh cost;
- raw SDK, SdFat, GPIO, rendering, settings, or i18n access that bypasses established boundaries;
- activity enter/exit ownership, member handles, task shutdown, and use-after-free paths;
- logical buttons, all four orientations, viewable bounds, single-framebuffer behavior, and grayscale-buffer restoration;
- cache/version implications and hardware states the host build cannot verify.

Do not claim a resource regression without the mechanism and worst-case size or timing path. Report severity, `file:line`, mechanism, likely hardware symptom, and fix. Include concrete measurements or device checks that would confirm uncertain risks. A clean result is normal.

**Done when:** every resource-owning or hardware-facing hunk is accounted for and every finding explains its physical or memory mechanism.
